We designed and realized the relational clone of the Spotify database for an university project.

But what is a database **without a way to use it?**

That's why we decided to implement a ReactJs frontend and a Flask backend in **less than 24 hours.**

A small challenge to increase the productivity ðŸ˜‰

## How to install

1. Execute every[^1] SQL file in order `./db`
2. Change database configs in `backend/src/__init__.py`
3. Start backend:
   
```bash
$ cd backend

$ pipenv shell

$ pipenv install

$ cd src

$ python3 app.py
```

4. Start frontend:
   
```bash
$ cd frontend

$ npm run install

$ npm run start
```
5. Visit `localhost:3000`

**Enjoy!** ðŸ˜Ž

[^1]: `similarity.sql` is the recommendation engine's data that we use to create Daily Suggestion playlists. You can skip the execution of that file since it takes a bit (400k lines ðŸ˜®).
